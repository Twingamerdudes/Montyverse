# Montyverse
Welcome to the Montyverse. In this secruity breach mod a Monty will spawn every 15 seconds.
## Installing Guide
### Setup and installation
Go to releases, then download the pack. After that, download [UML](https://github.com/RussellJerome/UnrealModLoader/releases/tag/v2.2.0)

Run fnaf security breach with UML open. Then close it. This will setup the folder path you need **(Skip this if you have already used UML or have downloaded a skizzum mod via it's launcher)**

Now drag the pak file into (game path)/fnaf9/Content/Paks/LogicMods
The mod should be ready now
### Using the mod
First open up UML and then secruity breach.
Now play through the game until you get to the spot you want to activate the mod in (I would recommend rockstar row at 11:30 PM)

When you are in your desired spot and you want to activate the mod, press F1, navigate to Logic Mods -> Montyverse -> Mod buttons

Now click start. The chaoes has now begun!
